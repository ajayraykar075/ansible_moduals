File Name in Destination Path:

    Specified dest: /tmp/ajay.txt to ensure the file is copied with the correct filename. If you only specify /tmp/, the file might be copied without the correct filename, depending on your setup.

Backup Option:

    backup: true will create a backup of the existing file at the destination before replacing it.

Owner:

    The owner: root sets the file owner to root. Ensure this is intended and that you have appropriate permissions.

Optional group and mode:

    You can add group and mode fields if you need to specify group ownership or file permission
